Brief Description: 

This assignment focuses on studying and simulating Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols in computer networks, specifically examining the channel access protocol used in a Bozon colony. Bozons in this colony alternate between periods of sleep and yodelling. The main goal is to analyze the protocol's performance by measuring the average behaviour of the channel, including the percentage of time it remains silent, melodious, or screechy. Additionally, the assignment involves exploring different Bozon configuration scenarios, determining the optimal colony size, and evaluating the scalability of Bozon colonies.


Objective: 

Learn Media Access Control (MAC) protocols
